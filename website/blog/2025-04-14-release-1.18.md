Podman Desktop 1.18 Release! 🎉

![podman-desktop-hero-1.18](/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.18/banner.png)

Podman Desktop 1.18 is now available! [Click here to download it](/downloads)!

This release brings exciting new features and improvements:

- **Refining the Docker Compatibility feature**: The Docker Compatibility page has been moved out of experimental mode, and now it helps you fully set up Podman even when installed through `brew`. It also detects and notifies you when Podman can't bind the Docker socket.
- **Switching Kubernetes namespace**: Switching between Kubernetes namespaces within Podman Desktop is now available.
- **Jobs in Kubernetes**: You can now see Kubernetes jobs in our growing Kubernetes section of Podman Desktop.
- **Experimental status bar providers enhancements**: Status bar providers can be pinned and unpinned based on user preferences and the provider status icons have been updated to be easier to understand.

## Release Details

### Docker Compatibilty mode page is out of experimental mode 🎉

The experimental Docker Compatibility page that was introduced in [v1.13](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.13#docker-compatibility-mode-page) has been moved out of experimental mode. Now everything related to Docker compatibility can be found in one place. In addition, new Docker compatibility related notifications have been added to make the set up process easier and less guesswork when running into problems.

  }}
/>

### Switching Kubernetes namepaces

Until now, only switching Kubernetes contexts was supported in Podman Desktop. With this update, you can now switch between namespaces from within Podman Desktop without having to do anything outside the app. The selection does not modify your Kube config and is persistent across the app, so if you select a specific namespace in one place, it will be used everywhere else in Podman Desktop.

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/Kubernetes-namespaces-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

### Kubernetes Jobs

As part of our ongoing Kubernetes improvement and enhancement efforts, a new tab has been added for Kubernetes Jobs. You can now view the jobs, all in one place, with details page for each one, and have the ability to delete and view condition statuses.

  }}
/>

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/job-details-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

### Experimental status bar providers enhancements

The experimental status bar providers that were introduced in [v1.16](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.16#providers-appear-in-the-status-bar) have undergone some changes to make them easier to understand and use.

The new provider status icons include:

- white dot - running
- red dot - error
- up arrow - update available
- spinning circle - stopping or starting
- darker icon - stopped

In addition, you can now choose which available providers to show by pinning or unpinning them from the status bar:

    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.18/statusbar-provider-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>

If you have any feedback or thoughts about our experimental features (or any aspect of Podman Desktop at all), feel free to let us know in the relevant [experimental feature github discussion](https://github.com/podman-desktop/podman-desktop/discussions/categories/experimental-features), which can be accessed from the experimental tab in the settings page, or by clicking on the comment icon in the lower right side of Podman Desktop and filling out the feedback form.

### Additional changes
